I am interested in building AGI and creating AI tools that enhance our core capabilities. Before starting <a href="https://csm.ai/" style="color: rgb(0,255,0)">Common Sense Machines</a>, I was a Senior Scientist at Google DeepMind in the Deep Learning and Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning team. 
Before that I was a PhD student at MIT in Josh Tenenbaum's group in the Brain & Cognitive Sciences and CSAIL departments. 

Currently I am interested in building an AI learns to create and program 3D worlds.
